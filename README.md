# VSC22 Winner Solutions 

The code reproduce the results of our solutions on both tracks for [Meta AI Video Similarity Challenge (CVPR 2023 Workshop)](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/101/meta-video-similarity-descriptor/).

Our solutions got **the first place** on **both tracks**, including Descriptor Track and Matching Track.

## Dependencies
We provide DockerFiles to help you build a runnable environment directly.
Or you can run setup.sh to install each package on your runnable environment.

## Usage

Cause our matching solution partialy depend on the results of descriptor solution, you should **reproduce the results of descriptor track first**.

## Details 
Please refer to `VSC22-Descriptor-Track-1st` and `VSC22-Matching-Track-1st` for more details.
